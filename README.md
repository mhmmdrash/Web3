SaleNftContract:
Create an ERC721 NFT contract. Add a functionality where anyone can mint the NFT. The NFT owner can then put it on sale by setting a price. Any other user can buy the NFT which is on sale. Original creator would get 10% of the sale amount on every sale. The price would be in terms of an ERC20 (INR) or ETH.
